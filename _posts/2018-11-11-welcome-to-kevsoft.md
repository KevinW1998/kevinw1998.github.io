Hey there! Glad you found your way onto my blog.

My name is Kevin Waldock (also known as Kevsoft) and my focus relies on binary hacking and high performance coding. 
My motto is "extending by hacking" which I executed on projects like [LunaLua](https://wohlsoft.ru/LunaLua/) or [Age of Empires Online](https://projectceleste.com/).

Happy Coding!
