My name is Kevin Waldock. I am a passionate programmer for over a decade now. I have been involved in various
projects, most notably as being the creator of [LunaLua](https://wohlsoft.ru/LunaLua/) and as a lead developer
of the community project "Project Celeste" also known as the [Age of Empires Online private server](https://projectceleste.com/).

I have completed a [technical college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6here_Technische_Lehranstalt), which is a special form of 
high school in Austria (5 years) with a focus on a specialisation. In my case it was information technology. 
Currently I am doing the mandetory alternative civilian service in Austria.
